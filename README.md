Out of Jail 808347 is a narrative Web3 quest built at the intersection of AI, music, and blockchain — designed for a worldwide audience with a strategic focus on the Asian market via TZ APAC and the Etherlink ecosystem.

🎮 WHAT IS IT?
An AI-driven interactive confession quest where self-exploration is the core mechanic.
You wake in Creature 808347— a cyberpunk-Egyptian digital prison outside of time and space. The only way forward is truth. Confess to AI Overseer Noemi. Face The Creature. Unlock your past.
Every completed session anchors your progress on-chain and rewards you with Memory Capsules — NFTs containing original music from the Prisoner's Album.

📊 WHY ETHERLINK?
FactorWhy It MattersEVM CompatibleZero-friction migration from Base alphaLow Gas FeesCritical for micro-transactions (each confession = on-chain event)Tezos SecurityEnterprise-grade infrastructure for long-term IPTZ APAC NetworkDirect access to Asian Web3 market — our primary targetSingapore HubAligns with our Georgia × Singapore studio positioning

🌏 MARKET POSITIONING
Primary: Asia-Pacific Web3 gaming market via TZ APAC
Secondary: Global Farcaster/Base ecosystem
Niche: Narrative games + mental health exploration + music NFTs
Why this market has no competitor:

Web3 gaming = financial mechanics (farms, P2E) — zero emotional depth
Mental health apps = clinical, inaccessible
Music NFTs = disconnected from narrative

Out of Jail 808347 = the intersection of all three.
